# 🐍 100 Days of Python – Learning Journey

This repository documents my **100-day Python challenge**.

The goal is simple: **show up every day, learn something concrete, and commit progress publicly**. No fluff. Just fundamentals → mastery.

---

## 📅 Day 1 – Python Basics

### What I learned

* How to use `print()` to display output
* That quotation marks `""` indicate a **string**
* How to use `\n` to start a new line
* How `input()` works to receive user input
* How to swap two variables using a **temporary variable**

### Key Concepts

* Python reads code **top to bottom**
* Strings are immutable text values
* User input is always received as a **string** by default

## 📅 Day 2 – Data Types & Operations

### What I learned

* Different **data types** (`int`, `float`, `str`, etc.)
* Computers start counting from zero → index `[0]` is the **first** item
* Negative indexing counts from the back

  ```python
  print("Hello"[-1])  # outputs 'o'
  ```
* You can use `_` (underscore) in large numbers for readability

  ```python
  1_000_000 == 1000000
  ```
* The `type()` function shows a variable’s data type
* Any division (`/`) returns a **float**
* Floor division (`//`) returns an **integer**
* Exponents use `**`
* Order of operations:

  1. Parentheses `()`
  2. Exponents `**`
  3. Multiplication `*` and Division `/`
  4. Addition `+` and Subtraction `-`
* How to use `round()`
* How to format output using **f-strings**

📅 Day 3 – Control Flow & Logic

What I learned

= assigns a value, == compares values and returns a boolean

How if, elif, and else control program flow

The modulo operator % to check remainders (e.g. even/odd logic)

Nested if statements and when they become a readability problem

Using logical operators and / or to combine conditions

## 🔥 Challenge Rules

* Code **every day**
* Commit progress daily
* Focus on understanding, not speed
* No skipping fundamentals

## 🎯 End Goal

By Day 100, I aim to:

* Be fully comfortable with Python fundamentals
* Write clean, readable, and efficient code
* Have a public proof-of-work trail on GitHub
